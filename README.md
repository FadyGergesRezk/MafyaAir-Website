# ✈️ Mafya Air

Mafya Air is an Airline Reservation System through which individuals can reserve and pay for flights in order to travel to different countries.

## Project Description and How to Use It

Our website is the best place to reserve your next flight. With it, you can do the following:

1. 🔍 **Inquiry Section**: Use this section to have a look at our flights. You can search for your desired flight using departure or return airports, choose the date, and select the number of seats. You can read all the details of any flight you're interested in.

2. 📝 **Reservation Section**: Once you've made your decision, go to the reservation section. Search using the same criteria as in the Inquiry Section, but this time select both the departure and return flights as our website offers round-trip trips.

3. ✈️ **Seat Selection**: After choosing your departure and return flights, select the seats you want based on availability and the number of seats you entered in the search section.

4. 💼 **Summary and Booking**: You will be provided with a summary of both flights and the total price before proceeding to book.

5. 🔐 **Login and Signup**: To book your chosen flights, log in to the website if you already have an account. Otherwise, sign up to join our customers and enjoy our trips.

6. 💳 **Payment**: Once you're ready to book, choose your preferred payment method: MasterCard or Visa.

7. 📧 **Payment Confirmation**: After making the payment, you will receive an email with the amount you have paid.

8. 📋 **Profile Section**: After logging in to Mafya Air, you will have access to your profile section. Here, you can enter your information, such as passport number, age, and full name.

9. 🔑 **Change Password**: If you want to change your password, enter the old password and the new one. Your password will be updated accordingly.

10. 📅 **Reserved Flights**: In your profile section, you can view all your reserved flights with their details.

11. ❌ **Cancellation**: If you decide to cancel your reservation, you will receive an email with the refunded amount.

12. ✏️ **Flight Editing**: You can edit some details of your reserved flights. Search for the desired flight with the new details (e.g., number of seats, excluding departure and return dates), choose the new flight, and your old flight will be replaced. You will receive an email with the refunded amount.

*Note: Changing only the chosen seats does not require a new search.*
